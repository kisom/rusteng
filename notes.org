#+TITLE: Illustrated Guide to Building Software with Rust

* Intro

  + Learning a new language:
    + Works best with an actual project to build
    + Multiple concerns
      + Language syntax / idioms
      + How do I engineer a project
	+ Package / dependency management
	+ Initial project structure
	+ Documentation
	+ Testing
      + How do I find existing functionality?
	+ NIH is fun but nothing will get done
	+ "To make an apple pie you must first invent the universe"
          and then 14 billion years later you have an apple pie
	+ I'm hungry now, and the universe exists
  + Wanted to learn rust, but somewhat burned out on computers.
  + I have a specific set of goals:
    + Either do something novel (i.e. put thought into what I'm making)
    + or learn a new language
    + This is just due to the particulars of my current circumstances.
  + Project idea:
    + A key-value store with an HTTP UI
      + Writes are done with JSON POST requests (to /key)
      + Reads are done with url parameters (e.g. /key) and return JSON
      + Systems programming topics:
	+ Serialisation
	+ Disk I/O (e.g. to persist the store)
	+ Basic data structures (hash map of strings to structures)
	+ Reading command line arguments
	+ Basic HTTP server
      + Why? this is the kind of thing that I can quickly put together
        in Go; it's something I have a pretty good idea on how to
        build a simple version of.
	+ In fact, the kvdemo.go example was written in about an hour
          and a half.
      + A half-hearted spec:
	+ The store is persisted on disk in a single file.
	+ Key/value pairs are added to the store by POSTing to /<key>
	  with a JSON dictionary; the value goes under the "value" key.
	+ Values are returned by GETting /<key>.
	+ Metrics (which double as a health check) are obtained by
          GETting the index path.


* First steps

** Setting up Rust
  
   + Use rustup: https://www.rustup.rs/
   + Try to use stable where possible.

** Initialising the project

   + =$ cargo new --bin --vcs git --color never kvdemo=
   + Adding new packages to project:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ echo 'getopts = "0.2.14"' >> Cargo.toml
#+END_EXAMPLE

   + The dependencies for this project so far:
     + getopts for CLI argument parsing
     + hyper for the HTTP server
     + rustc_serialize::json for JSON serialisation
     + time for Unix timestamps

   + Cargo.toml
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[package]
name = "kvdemo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Kyle Isom <coder@kyleisom.net>"]

[dependencies]
getopts = "0.2.14"
hyper = "0.9.9"
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Adding command line options

  + src/main.rs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
extern crate getopts;
use getopts::Options;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let mut opts = Options::new();
    opts.optopt("a", "", "Address server should listen on.", "ADDRESS");
    opts.optopt("f", "", "Path to disk store.", "FILE");
    opts.optflag("h", "help", "Print a short usage message.");

    let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) {
        Ok(m) => { m }
        Err(f) => { panic!(f.to_string()) }
    };

    if matches.opt_present("h") {
        let brief = format!("Usage: {} FILE [options]", args[0]);        
        print!("{}", opts.usage(&brief));
        return;
    }

    let mut addr: String  = "localhost:8000".to_string();
    if matches.opt_present("a") {
        match matches.opt_str("a") {
            Some(a) => { addr = a; }
            None    => { panic!("address argument present but unavailable."); }
        };
    }

    let mut store_file: String = "store.json".to_string();
    if matches.opt_present("f") {
        match matches.opt_str("f") {
            Some(f) => { store_file = f; }
            None    => { panic!("store file argument present but unavailable."); }
        };
    }

    println!("listening on {}", addr);
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

  + extern crate...use
  + collect: =env::args()= returns an *iterator* over the CLI
    arguments; =collect= turns this into a string vector.
    + could have defined as Vec<_>: the _ indicates type deduction.
  + let mut opts: create a mutable variable options
  + opts.opt*: empty second string lit => no long opt
    + general form: short, long, desc, hint
  + match: pattern matching
    + parse() returns a something like a Maybe Matches (Ok(m), Fail)
    + panic! throws an abort (! => macro)
  + string formatting and printing: format!/print!
  + so getopt feels a bit clunky here with the let -> present -> match pattern
    + define the variable to store the arg with a default
    + if it was set in the args, then the value needs to be extracted
    + opt_str returns the argument as an Option type (Rust's version of Maybe)
      + Just x  => Some(x)
      + Nothing => None
    + Given the call to present, any None value is a panicable result.
    + String literals: use a separate type (`&'static str`), so needs
      to be coerced into a String.
      + String: heap strings, useful for mutable string types
      + str: immutable sequence of bytes
      + Go equivalent: String is string, str is []byte
	+ but in Go, strings can't be modified (e.g. s[1] = 'x' is
          invalid) while []bytes can


* Creating the data store

  + hash map of keys to values
  + values have additional metadata: timestamp, version
  + store has additional data: last update, last write to disk, disk errors

  + defining structures

  + getting timestamps
