# Introduction

Why this document? I wanted to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
but I couldn't find any documents like this one. I decided to dive in
and write this in the hope that it helps other people.

I personally learn new programming languages best when I have an
actual project to build (just like it's much easier to learn a new
language via immersion). My interests in learning new programming
languages are less about the mechanics of the language (that will
come over time) and more geared towards how to build something:

+ How is the typical project structured?
+ Is there a particular method for bootstrapping a new project?
+ How do I manage library dependencies?
+ How do I use those dependencies in my projects?
+ How do I document my project?
+ How do I document the code?
+ How do I do unit and integration tests?

I'd also look for how to find existing functionality. To quote Carl
Sagan,

> If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent
> the universe.

and while building everything from scratch is fun, it takes 14 billion
years to get an apple pie and I'm hungry now.

Lately, I've also been a bit burned out on computers and the
smouldering garbage fire that is modern software engineering, so the
project needed to be something that I already knew how to do.
